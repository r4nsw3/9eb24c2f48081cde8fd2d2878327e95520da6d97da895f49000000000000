  |   Bob is just a normal human with no superpowers, but given the right   |
  |   tools he can do a lot. Misuse the tools and he can do even more!      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The world of Human: Fall Flat features advanced physics and           |
  |   innovative controls that cater for a wide range of challenges.        |
  |   Bob's dreams of falling are riddled with puzzles to solve and         |
  |   distractions to experiment with for hilarious results. The worlds     |
  |   may be fantastical, but the laws of physics are very real.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Will you try to open that mysterious door, or would you rather see    |
  |   how far you can throw a speaker set out that window?                  |
  |                                                                         |
